Changelog
=========

3.0.0 â€“ UNRELEASED
------------------

- BREAKING: All pseudo-elements (box-sizing, cleafix) use proper `::` syntax.
- BREAKING: Nested items in the `$z-index` list start with `1` rather than `2`,
  so that `main, nav item dropdown, overlay`
  will generate indexes of `1, 2 1 2, 3` respectively.
  This matches more closely the way nested z-indexes work in the browser.
- BREAKING: Remove `$inherit` option from `box-sizing`
  (because it's a bad idea to inherit box properties).
  You can still replicate the behavior by setting box-sizing on the root,
  and passing `inherit` as an argument to the mixin.
- BREAKING: Remove `micro-clearfix` in favor of `clearfix` alias.
  The only other reliable clearfix is `overflow: hidden` -
  and we don't need a mixin for that.
- BREAKING: Remove `$accoutrement-query-context` and `_apply-query()`
  for lack of use-cases.
- BREAKING: Rename `$_ACCOUTREMENT-ASPECT-RATIOS`
  to make it private, and signify that it remains constant.
- BREAKING: Remove automatic `browser-ems` conversion,
  in favor of explicit breakpoint values/units.
  For unit-conversion and more helpful size-utilities,
  see [Accoutrement-Scale](http://oddbird.net/accoutrement-scale/).
  Also remove `$_BROWSER-DEFAULT-FONT-SIZE`, since it's no longer needed.
- BREAKING: `rem` values are treated like `em` values
  when removing media-query overlap.
- BREAKING: Remove `stretch` mixins, as an over-specific use-case.
- NEW: Add a single `position` mixin using the common TRBL syntax
  to provide a shortcut for positioning properties
  (`top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, and `position`).
